plan:
track how many times in the week the soil has been irrigated 
have weekly report of water usage 
pick a random day that it will rain 
pick random depth of rain 
do math of how much water the sprinklers are using 

do a sum up of how much water is expected to be used today 
: then on the next day sumn up how much water was used and if it stopped ever because of rain

have a day by day systme doing mockups like stardew valley 


 water facts:
 # sprinklers are usually to be on for about 20 to 30 minutes 
 #12-30 gallons are used per minute 
 # u want to use the sprinklers at least 2-3 times a week
 #sprinkler systems shut off at 1/8 inch rain to a inch rain
